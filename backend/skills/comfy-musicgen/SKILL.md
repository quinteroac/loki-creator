# comfy-musicgen

Use this skill for local music generation through the `comfy-musicgen` CLI. The
CLI uses ACE-Step 1.5 model files under `.loki/models/comfyui`. If built-in
ACE-Step files are missing, use `comfy-model-downloader` for
`musicgen.generate` before running inference.

Critical: ACE-Step is not an instruction-following chat model. Never pass the
user's natural-language request directly to `--prompt`. The `--prompt` value must
be a comma-separated ACE-Step music caption/tag list. Convert requests such as
"Generate a sad J-pop song in Japanese, 2:30 duration, 92 BPM, minor key" into:

```text
Japanese J-pop, Japanese vocal, melancholic mood, modern production, 92 BPM, A minor
```

Then pass duration, BPM, language, and key as structured CLI params when known.

The CLI is quiet by default and prints only final JSON. Use `--verbose` only when
debugging ComfyUI runtime output, warnings, or progress bars.

If `comfy-musicgen` or `comfy-models` is not available, use
`comfy-tools-setup` first. In this repository, prefer `uv run comfy-musicgen`;
outside the repo, let `comfy-tools-setup` install the CLIs with `uv tool`.

At the start of every music workflow, start or reuse the local Comfy Media
gallery for the active output directory:

```bash
uv run comfy-media gallery --out outputs --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

Use `comfy-media --help` only if the CLI is missing or behaves unexpectedly; do
not skip the gallery just because generation can run headless.

If `.comfy-agent-tools.json` is missing or the user wants to configure a new
ACE-Step checkpoint/fine-tune/default, use `comfy-model-onboarding` first.

If model validation fails with `missing_model_file`, use `comfy-model-downloader`
for `musicgen.generate`.

If the user asks to use or organize a LoRA by name or purpose, use
`comfy-lora-onboarding` to search `loras/ace-step-1.5/` first and pass the
chosen file with `--extra-lora`. Treat ACE-Step LoRAs as experimental until a
local smoke test confirms compatibility.

## Mode

- `generate`: music prompt tags plus optional lyrics to a WAV file.

## Command

Generate instrumental music:

```bash
uv run comfy-musicgen generate \
  --prompt "lofi hip hop, instrumental beat, warm Rhodes piano, mellow brushed drums, round electric bass, tape saturation, intimate late-night mood, clean mix, 82 BPM" \
  --lyrics "[instrumental]" \
  --duration 120 \
  --steps 64 \
  --cfg 7.0 \
  --seed 0 \
  --extra-lora .loki/models/comfyui/loras/ace-step-1.5/vocal-polish.safetensors:0.5:0.0 \
  --out outputs
```

Generate with lyrics:

```bash
uv run comfy-musicgen generate \
  --prompt "Latin pop ballad, polished radio production, nylon guitar arpeggios, warm electric bass, soft live drums, intimate male vocal, emotional chorus lift, clean modern mix, 92 BPM, A minor" \
  --lyrics "[verse]\nLa luna cae sobre el mar\nTu nombre vuelve a respirar\n\n[chorus]\nQuedate cerca de mi\nCuando la noche quiera caer\n\n[instrumental]\n\n[bridge]\nNo hay distancia para olvidar\nLo que aprendimos a cuidar\n\n[chorus]\nQuedate cerca de mi\nCuando la noche quiera caer" \
  --language es \
  --bpm 92 \
  --keyscale "A minor" \
  --steps 64 \
  --cfg 7.0 \
  --out outputs
```

Fast smoke test:

```bash
uv run comfy-musicgen generate \
  --prompt "lofi hip hop beat, warm Rhodes piano, mellow drums, tape texture" \
  --lyrics "[instrumental]" \
  --steps 8 \
  --cfg 1 \
  --duration 30 \
  --out outputs
```

## Prompt Guidance

ACE-Step works best when `--prompt` and `--lyrics` are treated as separate inputs.
Use `--prompt` as the music caption: a comma-separated tag list describing the
overall song portrait. Always rewrite vague user requests into a complete caption
before calling the CLI. A strong caption includes these pieces, in this order:

1. Primary genre and subgenre.
2. Vocal intent or `instrumental`.
3. Core instruments and rhythm section.
4. Mood, era, or scene.
5. Production texture and mix target.
6. Tempo in BPM and optional key.

Keep tags focused and non-contradictory; prefer one main style with one or two
secondary influences instead of a long list of clashing genres. Use English tag
phrases even when the user speaks another language, unless quoting lyrics.

Good tag shape:

```text
Japanese city pop, catchy female vocal, bright synth hooks, upbeat drums, electric bass, glossy 1980s mix, nostalgic summer mood, 132 BPM
```

Do not put full sentences like "make a song about..." into `--prompt`. Convert
them to musical tags. Put story, theme, and emotional arc into the caption only
as short musical descriptors such as `heartbreak lyrics`, `hopeful chorus`, or
`dark cinematic tension`.

Use `--lyrics` only when sung or spoken content is desired. Structure lyrics with
concise section markers such as `[verse]`, `[chorus]`, `[bridge]`,
`[instrumental]`, and `[outro]`. The lyrics field is the temporal script: it can
include short section performance hints such as `[chorus - anthemic]` or
`[bridge - whispered]`, but avoid stacking several tags in one marker. Keep lines
singable: short phrases, natural vowels, clear emotional turns, and enough
breathing room. Add `[instrumental]`, `[guitar solo]`, or `[drum break]` between
sections for solos or breaks.

Maintain consistency between caption and lyrics. If the caption says `intimate
male vocal`, do not mark a chorus as `female choir`; if the caption says
`minimal acoustic`, do not ask the lyrics for an explosive EDM drop.

For instrumental tracks, put `[instrumental]` or `[inst]` in `--lyrics` and also
include an instrumental cue in `--prompt`. If lyrics are left empty, the model may
still infer vocal texture from tags like `female vocal` or `male voice`; avoid
vocal tags for instrumental tracks unless the user wants wordless vocal texture.

Match `--language` to the lyrics language, for example `en`, `es`, `ja`, `zh`,
`fr`, or `ko`. For multilingual lyrics, prefer one dominant language per run; if
the language is not pronounced well, try romanized lyrics plus the matching
language code.

Use `--duration` for target song length in seconds. The final WAV metadata is in
the JSON response; read `duration_seconds`, `sample_rate`, and `channels` from
the response instead of assuming the model returned the exact target length.

Use the bridge quality defaults for normal generation: `steps=64` and `cfg=7.0`.
ACE-Step 1.5 Base benefits from more denoising steps and supports CFG; official
guidance describes Base as typically useful around 32-64 steps, with CFG usually
in the 5.0-9.0 range. Use `cfg=7.0` first. If the result is too literal or harsh,
try `cfg=5.0`; if it ignores the caption, try `cfg=8.0` or `9.0`. For quick
smoke tests only, override with `--steps 8 --cfg 1 --duration 30`.

When the user asks for "better quality", prefer changing the caption first, then
run at `steps=64`, `cfg=7.0`, and a fixed seed for comparison. Do not raise CFG
above `9.0` unless explicitly experimenting; high CFG can make artifacts worse.

## Prompt Templates

Instrumental:

```bash
uv run comfy-musicgen generate \
  --prompt "cinematic orchestral score, instrumental, legato strings, warm brass, soft timpani, emotional slow build, wide film mix, 72 BPM, D minor" \
  --lyrics "[instrumental]" \
  --duration 120 \
  --steps 64 \
  --cfg 7.0 \
  --out outputs
```

Song with structure:

```bash
uv run comfy-musicgen generate \
  --prompt "English synth pop, catchy female vocal, bright synth hooks, punchy drums, electric bass, glossy radio production, uplifting chorus, 124 BPM, C major" \
  --lyrics "[verse]\nI see the morning in your eyes\nA little fire in the city lights\n\n[chorus]\nHold on, we are running higher\nHands up into the open sky\n\n[instrumental]\n\n[chorus]\nHold on, we are running higher\nHands up into the open sky" \
  --language en \
  --bpm 124 \
  --keyscale "C major" \
  --steps 64 \
  --cfg 7.0 \
  --out outputs
```

Troubleshooting:

- Rushed vocals: reduce lyric word count, shorten lines, or add `[instrumental]` breaks.
- Weak backing track: add concrete instrument tags and production terms.
- Muddled style: remove contradictory tags and choose a clearer primary genre.
- Wrong language or pronunciation: set `--language` explicitly and simplify lyrics.
- Harsh or artifact-heavy audio: keep `steps=64`, lower `cfg` toward `5.0`, and
  simplify the caption.
- Ignored style: keep the caption concise, repeat the most important style word
  once, and raise `cfg` toward `8.0` or `9.0`.

## Defaults

- Models directory: `.loki/models/comfyui`
- Diffusion model: `diffusion_models/acestep_v1.5_base.safetensors`
- Text encoder 0.6B: `text_encoders/qwen_0.6b_ace15.safetensors`
- Text encoder 1.7B: `text_encoders/qwen_1.7b_ace15.safetensors`
- VAE: `vae/ace_1.5_vae.safetensors`
- Audio params: `duration=120`, `bpm=120`, `time_signature=4`, `keyscale=C major`, `language=en`
- Bridge quality sampling params: `steps=64`, `cfg=7.0`, `sampler=euler`, `scheduler=simple`, `seed=0`
- CLI/profile fallback sampling params: `steps=32`, `cfg=7.0`, `sampler=euler`, `scheduler=simple`, `seed=0`
- Output format: WAV PCM 16-bit
- Dependency: `comfy-diffusion[comfyui,video,audio]`

Extra LoRAs are optional and ad hoc. Use repeatable
`--extra-lora PATH[:MODEL_STRENGTH[:CLIP_STRENGTH]]` after resolving the file
through `loras/ace-step-1.5/` or the loose `loras/` fallback. If ComfyUI rejects
the LoRA, report that it may not be compatible with ACE-Step.

## Output Handling

The CLI prints JSON to stdout. On success, read `artifacts` for the saved WAV
path and audio metadata fields for playback details. On failure, read `error`
and `error_type`; do not parse logs for control flow.

Project-bound audio should be saved under the current workspace. Do not overwrite
existing assets unless the user explicitly asks for replacement.

After every successful music command, immediately index the same output
directory so the new artifact appears in Comfy Media:

```bash
uv run comfy-media index --out outputs
```
